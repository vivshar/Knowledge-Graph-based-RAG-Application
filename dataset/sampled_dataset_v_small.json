The menu offers a wide selection of breakfast and sandwich items, all reasonably priced.\n\nOn a quest for a good meal from a non-chain restaurant, I searched Yelp and found Dot's.  I'd driven past Dot's several times and thought about trying it, and now I'm glad I did.\n\nI found easy parking right on the corner, and was encouraged when I saw local law enforcement and taxi drivers dining here.  Greeted when I entered, I decided to sit at the classic diner counter.  The interior is nicely done in a semi-50's diner motif, with a fair amount of seating including booths and tables.  Flat-panel TVs with CNN and ESPN gave you something to watch if the local color didn't somehow maintain your interest.  The waitress promptly provided me with a menu and asked for my drink order, all the while greeting other diners as they came in, many by their first names (obviously a local favorite.)\n\nAfter reading about the Crawfish Julie (thanks Meli E.), I decided to have the seafood omelet with hash browns.   Watching the cool looking cook whip up my omelet (she sure knew her way around the kitchen!), it was ready within a few minutes, and served with a buttermilk biscuit that was halved and then browned on the grill, a nice touch!  My omelet was delicious, as were the hash browns.  Despite my best efforts to limit how much I was going to eat, everything was so tasty I wound up eating it all.\n\nI checked out using a major credit card for under $10, and left with a satisfied smile on my face.

I associated it with a diner that you would see off of an old American film. I pictured a sweet old waitress serving me apple pie a la mode. Btw they ran out of ice cream at Dots so... there goes my dream. Oh well. \n\nI guess I walked into the diner with too high of expectations. The interior looked, without a better way of putting it, dirty and old. The waitress that served us wasn't particularly rude, but she didn't give us a smile either. It seemed as though she was there to do her job, not to enjoy it. \n\nNow to the food. We ordered meat pies as appetizers. They came out fairly quickly with the wait was less than ten minutes. The meat pies were tiny, fun-sized. But it was an appetizer, so I wasn't expecting a huge portion. There were six of them and they were served on a bed of lettuce with containers of ranch sauce on the side. As far as the lettuce goes, it pathetic attempt as sprucing up the presentation. The filling of the meat pie reminded me of a cheeseburger. Wasn't good, but wasn't bad. \n\nI ordered the roast beef and gravy on a bun. The bun was grilled and the roast beef was great. It was extremely messy, but hey, I wasn't complaining. After struggling with my sandwich, I finally resorted to using a knife and fork. This just goes to show how packed the sandwich was; again, not complaining one bit. I really actually enjoyed my entree. \n\nFor desert we ordered the strawberries and cream pancakes. The pancakes themselves were good. They had this eggy taste and this fluffiness to them that I found delightful. I do have a few complaints though. They did not let the pancakes cool down enough before putting the whipped cream on it, causing the cream to melt. Also, the strawberries were warm. They probably meant for the strawberries to be heated, but it didn't help with the melting whipped cream situation. \n\nAs far as price goes, it was moderate. For a lunch that consisted of an appetizer, two entrees, and an order of pancakes, the total was around $25. I also gave $5 as a tip so lunch costed just about $30. Not that bad. \n\nAm I willing to return to this place? Hmm.... I don't think so. I didn't hate my experience there, but I didn't love it either. It was okay and because of that I am not willing to make the trip out to Kenner for an \"okay\" experience.","combined_id":"r-h6iDFZlO8kKJWbhxSUhw__zU8uJthn3o5swP0LmfuqQ","businessDetails":"Dots Diner - Williams Blvd. in city Kenner state LA has 4.5 rating for 234 reviews, offers Diners, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Burgers food and it has attributes OutdoorSeating, RestaurantsPriceRange2, WiFi, RestaurantsTakeOut, HasTV, BusinessParking, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, Alcohol, BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsAttire, GoodForKids, NoiseLevel, Caters, BikeParking, Ambience, RestaurantsDelivery, DriveThru, GoodForMeal, RestaurantsReservations, HappyHour and lacks None.

I've been here a couple of times before.  Free pie Wednesday is good.  There's just a lot of restaurant choices so I don't eat here often.  We happened to be here on all you can eat chicken tenders night.  I didn't know they had that.  Anyway, my wife, son and I all got the tenders.  My wife ordered the regular, my son got chipotle and I requested the Nashville hot.  My son loved the taste of the chipotle.  My Nashville hot was okay, I just didn't like how it was soaked in sauce.  It made the breading soggy.  I should have asked for it on the side, but I didn't expect it to be like that.  I prefer Nashville hot to be more of a seasoning in the breading and not a wet sauce poured over the tenders.  I ate most of it, but some was just too soggy so I scrapped off the breading and ate the meat.  If you like very hot then O'Charley's Nashville hot really won't satisfy you.  It was spicy and had some heat but not really hot.  If you're familiar with Buffalo Wild Wings the heat level of O'Charley's \"hot\" would be in the range of BWW's Caribbean jerk.  The all you can eat tenders meal is a great deal.  With all of their specials throughout the week, and great coupons they mail, O'Charley's is a really good deal.  Good rolls and butter, good pie and a good deal.","combined_id":"-logNEvandmAlFLJYY9VPw_eS5KCIrpEB1Bp-uU1JJYyw","businessDetails":"O'Charley's Restaurant & Bar in city Hendersonville state TN has 2.5 rating for 31 reviews, offers Burgers, Southern, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes Alcohol, GoodForKids, RestaurantsReservations, RestaurantsPriceRange2, RestaurantsDelivery, HasTV, OutdoorSeating, DriveThru, BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsAttire, BikeParking, NoiseLevel, GoodForMeal, Ambience, BusinessParking, RestaurantsTakeOut, WiFi, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, HappyHour and lacks None.

This is the worst experience I have ever had with a site. My friends and I were trying to book a place for the Essence Festival in July. We knew how the housing would be an issue so we started looking for a place to stay at the end of Feb. We saw the French Quarter Suites offered Town homes, they looked nice, so we began to inquire. The process is usually pretty easy but working with Ms. Leslie was not. When asking questions about a 5br town home she would often skirt the questions and not give direct answers. She raised the prices on our stay, without our knowledge and refused to breakdown the price of our payment.  The pay for parking was never mentioned, and the we had to inquire why the invoice stated the town home was a one room annex NOT a 5 bedroom town house. The Frech Quarter Suites Hotel website and business are misleading and dishonest.","combined_id":"f0R5VnrjmA0nW5Q_2fvsnA_UflFt95PrKDc7g5oaXOrRQ","businessDetails":"French Quarter Suites Hotel in city New Orleans state LA has 3.0 rating for 46 reviews, offers Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel food and it has attributes RestaurantsPriceRange2, WiFi, BusinessAcceptsCreditCards and lacks None.

Simply put, we were very happy with almost everything about this hotel.  Its location cannot be beat -- just across the street from the French Quarter proper, on a major bus line, and about  a 7-minute walk to the heart of Bourbon Street.  Our room faced Rampart Street and we never had a problem with street noise.  Right next door, there's a gas station with a convenience store with a pretty good deli -- got a great chicken po boy there.  Our two-bedroom suite was like our own apartment (with a small fridge but no kitchen), and everything worked properly, and the place was clean and in good repair.  You can access the HDMI ports of the HDTV if you want to plug in a device. The wi-fi worked well for us the whole time -- watched a few TV shows on Netflix without any problems.  There are two pools which are kept a very nice temperature.  The back pool seemed a bit sketchy, but the main pool in their lovely courtyard is an oasis.  The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful, going out of their way to get us things like towels, and Dennis even sent us a text message the night before we left offering to assist us with reserving a cab the next morning.  It was also a great value -- less than $150 a night for a two-bedroom suite, a figure that includes taxes and fees.  The only complaint was that the continental breakfast was exceedingly weak, with a very small number of oddly chosen foods -- the menu consisted of sliced tomatoes, sliced cheese, sliced oranges and sliced grapefruit,and bread but no pastries, no apples or bananas -- and drinks were limited to coffee, water, and Sunny Delight.  The do-it-yourself waffles were a nice touch.  But this was truly a minor complaint, as any visitor to New Orleans should never eat breakfast -- only brunch -- and never in a hotel when there are so many other great dining options.  Overall, we were incredibly happy with our decision to stay here, and it's now the first spot I'll consider on a return visit.  UPDATE on 7\/9\/2018:  I've stayed at the Suites three times since my original review, and I still love it.  Nothing at all has changed -- except for the sad fact that Dennis passed away suddenly a couple of years ago.  The new\/remaining staff is totally competent, but Dennis' unique personality is missed.","combined_id":"bvEF7Wq2aMMwrHI1RTU-KA_UflFt95PrKDc7g5oaXOrRQ","businessDetails":"French Quarter Suites Hotel in city New Orleans state LA has 3.0 rating for 46 reviews, offers Event Planning & Services, Hotels, Hotels & Travel food and it has attributes RestaurantsPriceRange2, WiFi, BusinessAcceptsCreditCards and lacks None.

This one is located inside a mall, so it's relatively spacious and easy to get to. There's a huge parking lot encircling the mall, so no worries there either.\n\nThe Cafe Du Monde here is reminiscent of a mall food court level place. It's a quick service type where you order at the counter and you find your seat to enjoy your beignets and coffee at one of the few tables.\n\nIf you've never had a beignet, you're in for a treat. It's like a lighter doughnut with a mountain of powder sugar on top. Very messy, you'll need a pile of napkins to clean up afterwards. Eat them while they're fresh and hot! In comparison with the ones in the French Quarter, the quality is about the same.\n\nSo if you're looking for the infamous Cafe Du Monde beignet, you can try it at further locations. Less traffic, less tourists, faster service. Just the location isn't anywhere scenic, but it's part of the tradeoff.","combined_id":"D3Tj46atKBOHM9ZVKVQppQ_xkgbgwTlkhzwo4ya_eIW-g","businessDetails":"Cafe Du Monde in city Metairie state LA has 4.0 rating for 127 reviews, offers Coffee & Tea, Food, Donuts, Restaurants food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsPriceRange2, WiFi, RestaurantsTakeOut, BikeParking, RestaurantsDelivery, BusinessParking, OutdoorSeating and lacks None.

They had a selection of local microbrews (bottle, not draft) for those interested in getting a taste of Philly in beer form. Alas, I ordered my tacos, but had a little Scooby Doo moment when the arrived. Somehow the chef decided that it was okay to put such a delicate fish in premade taco shells...enough to makes this SoCal girl wince a little and question whether I should consume. Luckily the flavor of the fish was great.

About 5-10 minutes later they came and got us and sat us at our table. Our waiter (who was WONDERFUL and looked like Jared Leto - extra bonus-) came over and took our order and the food came out perfectly (as usual) and right on time.\n\nWe both got the filet, done rare and the spinach it came with was fantastic.

We literally sat there with our finished plates for about 15 minutes and i would attribute it to being busy but it wasn't even busy because at that point we were literally the only ones in the section we were in, and there was only a handful of people in the restaurant itself. We had to call over a staff member to get our waitress  and they ended up just getting our check for us and making up some lame excuse about our server doing some type of stock in the basement. If that was really the case though why didn't anyone else cover her table? It was obvious that we were finished for some time and looking around for our waitress and like 4 different staff members walked by our table at least 5 times.

A couple in our group were dissapointed they still didn't have the donuts in the menu (but that could have been two years ago), but the chocolate chip bread pudding and the key lime pie were write home about good.

The meatloaf is another hit, and the fried chicken and waffles made one of my good friends swoon for 20 minutes or so. The food is great.\n\nThe ambiance, however, is a bit more...raucous. It's a big, open, loud restaurant. Which, for the price range and meal options, should probably be expected. Still, though, it's annoying when you have to shout at dinner to be heard by the people sitting across from you.\n\nAnother reason for the four-star rating is that they don't take reservations.

I went to try out the brunch (who can do a bad brunch, right?). This place has definitely earned a spot as one of my favorite places for brunch. Honestly, the prices are a on the steep side, not surprising due to the area, and most of their side items SHOULD be included on most the breakfast plates. For example, I think the omelettes should come with a portion of tater totes or a fruit salad, however; you have to order that as an additional side. \n\nDespite this shortcoming on the brunch menu, the food and drinks are truly great! They have some of the BEST pancakes I have ever tasted! They are large enough to be shared by two people and can be served topped with warm maple syrup, bananas and walnuts. Not to mention they are flurry, buttery and melt in you mouth delicious. They are to DIE for. I ordered a fruit bowl (berries, grapes, apples) the Grasshopper milkshake and I tried the Quiche. The quiche was light and fluffy and came with a side salad. Again, tater totes should be added on the plate. In addition, the quiche should come with an additional slice, its that great. \n\nLast but not least, the drinks. I tried a White Cranberry Orange Sangria and an adult milkshake. The sangria was so-so. It came in a small wine glass which was a disappointment since it was about $9.00. I had better tasting and sizes elsewhere. On the other hand, the adult milkshake, you guessed it made with alcohol, was creamy delicious made with chocolate  and topped with mint.\n\nOverall, Jones for a Sunday Brunch is delicious!

Looking around, I was impressed with the 70's inspired retro decor- the shag carpet, the stone pillars, the cozy seating and comfortable booths perfect for lounging... while my boyfriend's immediate reaction was 'it seems like an upscale Denny's...' Giving a quick first glance at the menu and it appeared that might be the case- although I was hoping for better. \n\nWe each ordered a bloody mary (a weekend necessity that so few of our favorite brunch spots offer...) - they were great and the spicyness was done just right.  Our attentive waitress returned to take our orders- I got the heuvos rancheros and my boyfriend the salmon eggs benedict.  \n\nOur food arrived promptly- though the portions were a bit smaller than I had expected for the price we were paying (Is that how it worked in the 70s?).  My huevos rancheros was drenched in shredded cheese- the eggs were ok, though I felt the dish as a whole was a little bit of a mushy mess...usually when I order this dish you can actually see the tortilla shell and they use cooked black beans, though happy to see that they made this without the chorizo ...My boyfriend really enjoyed his salmon eggs benedict - althought thought the english muffin was odd and strangely thin.  We didn't really get the tater tots on the side....is this *really* '70's comfort food' or just plain high school cafeteria cuisine? \n\nOverall, our meal was a bit overpriced, but got the job done- I would have rated this a two based solely on the food, however, Jones gets a third star for good service, excellent bloody mary's, and cozy decor.   \n\nWill probably be back at some point for the bloody mary.","combined_id":"ec6LWxAaNSE3ykoyTdu5HA_d_tRshM-w6S4QxE4VVi8tQ","businessDetails":"Jones in city Philadelphia state PA has 3.5 rating for 1141 reviews, offers American (New), Restaurants, Southern, Diners, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsTakeOut, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsAttire, OutdoorSeating, GoodForKids, HasTV, BusinessParking, WiFi, RestaurantsPriceRange2, BYOBCorkage, Caters, NoiseLevel, BikeParking, DogsAllowed, Alcohol, HappyHour, RestaurantsTableService, RestaurantsReservations, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsDelivery, GoodForMeal, Ambience and lacks None.

The most recent occasion was a Friday evening for my dad's birthday before seeing a play at the nearby Walnut Street Theater.  It was early-ish for a Friday (around 6pm) so we were seated right away.  I really like the atmosphere in Jones.  It's very open and the decor is fun, yet soothing.  I love the fireplaces.\n\nMy dad picked the wine so I've never looked at the list, but what he chose was good.  We ordered the pierogies as an appetizer and for my meal I had the Texas BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich.  Dessert was the peanut butter pie with some of the excellent homemade ice cream on the side.  I don't remember what my parents ordered but everything was delicious and everyone was happy with their meals.  Good sized portions although the app only came with four pierogies which wasn't enough for three people...but maybe that's just me because I love pierogies and could have finished the entire plate myself...\n\nOur service was excellent.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable and helpful in making choices.\n\nIt's a pretty casual restaurant.  I'm sure on weekend evening especially you will see most patrons dressed nicely but my first time dining here was before a Phillies game in jeans and a sweatshirt and I didn't feel uncomfortable.  I would definitely recommend everyone gives Jones a try.","combined_id":"57vj9V7VTnrBao_qYBICmg_d_tRshM-w6S4QxE4VVi8tQ","businessDetails":"Jones in city Philadelphia state PA has 3.5 rating for 1141 reviews, offers American (New), Restaurants, Southern, Diners, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsTakeOut, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsAttire, OutdoorSeating, GoodForKids, HasTV, BusinessParking, WiFi, RestaurantsPriceRange2, BYOBCorkage, Caters, NoiseLevel, BikeParking, DogsAllowed, Alcohol, HappyHour, RestaurantsTableService, RestaurantsReservations, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsDelivery, GoodForMeal, Ambience and lacks None.

There's something for everyone and it's reasonably priced, especially for a Steven Starr restaurant. The interior makes you feel like you've been transported back in time to a 60s diner, but with a modern flare. They take reservations which is always a plus in Philly. \n\nFor appetizers, I've had the nachos and the hummus and pita. The nachos are really good, they're individually constructed so each one has a whopping helping of cheese, beans, and chicken. However, the portion is pretty small since it's just one layer of chips instead of a pile like you would normally expect. The hummus and pita is standard, nothing much to report on. \n\nMost of the time when I come I get the market salad. They bring a small clipboard with the options and you can check off whatever greens, protein, cheese, veggies, and dressing you desire. Recently, they've increased the price AND limited the amount of toppings you can get. Before you could check off however many boxes you wanted-- mine usually had like 2 boxes not checked.. I like variety in my salads! Now you can pick one protein, one cheese, and 5 toppings or be charged an extra price. It's still a good deal because the salads are ENORMOUS but I'm still a little bummed at the change. My most recent one (see pic) had spinach, spring mix, bacon, blue cheese, avocado, carrots, egg, black beans, chickpeas, almonds, and red wine vinaigrette. Delicious! I usually can only finish half (and I have a big appetite), so I usually have a nice lunch for the next day. Def worth the price. I've had the chicken and waffles before too which are pretty good and very filling. \n\nOverall this is a good choice for a casual dinner that is family friendly and affordable.

The first was last fall with work (gratis, natch) and more recently in June for my birthday.  The dining area is so fun with the Brady esque decor, and the relaxed wait staff really brings home the \"comfort\" feeling.\n\nWith work, we ordered up several appetizers to share, including the calamari and mac and cheese.  They were all devoured pretty quickly.  I got fried chicken and waffles, because I thought with that as an option it would be stupid not to get it.  It was fantastic.  People were fascinated when I told them what I had for dinner, since it sounds so random.  The chicken was great,  and the waffle was a nice balance of sweetness and super fluffy.  I was a bit taken back at the thought of the chicken gravy on the waffle, but it works.  For dessert, I had the pumpkin bread pudding, which tasted exactly what you would expect pumpkin pie in bread form to taste like.\n\nI wanted to go out in the city for my birthday, so I picked this place because it was a good value (relatively) since we had a group of 7.  Actually, that was just a bonus, since I really just wanted the chicken & waffles again.  They don't take reservations, so we tried to go earlier on a Sunday (around 6pm).   They ended up having to stick one person at the end of a table for 6, which made for some issues with people getting around them.  We got the pierogies, potato pancakes and calamari for appetizers...  and promptly ordered a 2nd round of each because they were so good.  I again had the chicken and waffles and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I also like the beer selection, especially when we split a larger bottle and they served it in brandy snifters.  A few people in my group ordered some of their specialty drinks and enjoyed them as well.\n\nBoth times I enjoyed the decor, food and service, however I noticed that the 2nd time, the portions seemed to go down but the price didn't change.  I haven't been able to verify this for certain, but my coworker agreed that he remembered getting a whole waffle with pieces of chicken on top last year.  The 2nd time, I only got a half waffle, and it didn't seem like as much chicken.  Also, the first time I went I was amazed at how tall the Duncan Hines cake was.  The 2nd time, it looked about 75% as big as I remembered.  \n\nI definitely say it's a place to try out, but not to frequent as often as you no longer get what you are paying for.","combined_id":"WXXBg_CUCDyCvKGxmMNCLg_d_tRshM-w6S4QxE4VVi8tQ","businessDetails":"Jones in city Philadelphia state PA has 3.5 rating for 1141 reviews, offers American (New), Restaurants, Southern, Diners, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsTakeOut, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsAttire, OutdoorSeating, GoodForKids, HasTV, BusinessParking, WiFi, RestaurantsPriceRange2, BYOBCorkage, Caters, NoiseLevel, BikeParking, DogsAllowed, Alcohol, HappyHour, RestaurantsTableService, RestaurantsReservations, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsDelivery, GoodForMeal, Ambience and lacks None.

When she told me how great her brunch was she was eager to take us back for dinner. I trusted that she had good taste and I would not be disappointed. Naturally, I walked into Jones with high expectations and the first impression I received was warm and comforting. The dim lighting and surrounding fire really made me feel at home. We arrived here without reservations but this was not seen as an issues or inconvenience to us or the workers. We were seated promptly and out order were taking almost immediately. Our waiter was fantastic. His name is Trevor and was very personable as well as many of the other employees who recognized my girlfriends grandmother and made it known. I always say, the impression the worker makes is the same  impression people leave with and how they feel about that reastraunt which in retrospect will determine whether a reastrsunt is worth going back to or not. Jones is definitely one to go back to. After we ordered out meals they came back to us in no time. The atmosphere makes it a lighthearted place to engage in conversation so it never feel like you're waiting to long for anything plus they waiters\/waitresses are on top of everything. Now as far as the food went. I've tried a little of everyone's entrees when we received them. Most of the food here is American but high end American at inexpensive prices. I ordered an Pull Pork sandwich and it definitely placed as one of the best I've ever had. Here is the best part of my experience here. because my girlfriends grandmother was recognized from earlier that day. The manager offered all three of free dessert on the house. I had  a peanut butter brownie Sunday which was superb and satisfied my stomach mind and body leaving me with nothing bad to say. I cannot wait to go back again . Thanks you Jones for everything.

The server was welcoming, came back several times to fill our iced tea glasses, and asked us, along with someone else, how our food was. Unfortunately, I had to offer some constructive feedback (OK, complain). I used to LOVE their turkey burger. Ordered it every time for the buttery bun and freshly ground turkey topped with a dollop of melting boursin cheese (similar to one of the burger preparations at Monks). Sadly, the burger this time was a thick patty more similar to the one they serve at Marathon. And the beef in my father's beef brisket sandwich was poorly seasoned. Perhaps I'll be back for some grilled cheese and tomato soup or another basic they probably do well.

It was my 24th birthday. It was a dreary early spring day. The first day of spring actually. I had just broken up with the guy I had been dating. I was deep in the 5 day slump I am allowed to have after a breakup. I don't believe in feeling bad for myself for more than 5 days. But I was in rare form and feeling bad for myself on that particular day. \n\nI'm not a big birthday person, and never one to plan something for myself. But when my 2 best friends insisted on taking me out, I wasn't about to decline. And so be it that an evening out with my girlfriends, fun cocktails, and comfort food courtesy of Steven Starr was just what I needed to break my funk! \n\nThere was about a 10 minute wait for a table when we arrived, so we sat down at the bar and ordered drinks. The cocktail list was so fun. We would have liked to try them all, but alas it was a Sunday night. The menu did not disappoint either. It was a creative twist on what would come out of my mom's kitchen. It went perfectly with the decor. The exposed brick and open kitchen made me feel like I was home. My friends ordered sandwiches and I had an entree. We were all pleased with our choices and the portions were large. I would have liked to try dessert because they sounded great, but I was just too full! \n\nJones is not my favorite Steven Starr, but it is a great alternative if you are looking for something a little less pretentious than its neighbors on Chestnut Street. It doesn't matter how fab you think you are, sometimes you just need some good old fashioned home cooking, and Jones will definitely hit the spot!","combined_id":"FpERPxhwIW9f16fDa0HYmw_d_tRshM-w6S4QxE4VVi8tQ","businessDetails":"Jones in city Philadelphia state PA has 3.5 rating for 1141 reviews, offers American (New), Restaurants, Southern, Diners, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsTakeOut, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsAttire, OutdoorSeating, GoodForKids, HasTV, BusinessParking, WiFi, RestaurantsPriceRange2, BYOBCorkage, Caters, NoiseLevel, BikeParking, DogsAllowed, Alcohol, HappyHour, RestaurantsTableService, RestaurantsReservations, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsDelivery, GoodForMeal, Ambience and lacks None.

I am so happy I went with Jones - it was just what we were looking for.  We wanted something special, but not fancy schmancy.  Of course, we also wanted solid food.  Jones fit the bill!  Somehow we got really lucky and were seated immediately at 9PM on Saturday night.  Nice surprise, considering we were expecting a wait.   So many things on the menu looked good, but we settled on the mac and cheese appetizer to start things off.   It was delicious - loved the bread crumbs on top.  I often order this at another restaurant at home, where it's served \"fancier\" with pancetta, truffle oil and mushrooms.  This mac and cheese was old school with delicious cheddar that melted in your mouth.  We literally scraped the dish clean.  I also liked the rolls that they served for the table.  I had the chicken pot pie as my entree and definitely made the right choice - it was so hearty, I almost want to go back on a cold night, just to order it.  Creamy and tasty, with plenty of carrots inside.  My husband may have made the one bad call of the evening - he ordered the jambalaya and didn't love it - it was ok, but he would order something else next time.  However, he was a big fan of the buttered peas that he ordered as a side.  Somehow, I still had room for dessert and seriously could have ordered just about any of the choices on the dessert menu - they all sounded so good.  We went with the carrot cake, because I had been craving it for a while.  Delicious!!  Our waiter was terrific - was on top of things and enthusiastic, but not obtrusive.  The swivel chairs were comfy and the place had a nice vibe.  My one and only complaint is that it is really noisy - the acoustics were terrible - I wouldn't suggest going here on a first date, as it's hard to hear even across the table.  Next time I'm in Philly, I'll be tempted to try somewhere new, but it will be very hard not to return to Jones.","combined_id":"DQ9cROfSpMy5wjEe2kLR4A_d_tRshM-w6S4QxE4VVi8tQ","businessDetails":"Jones in city Philadelphia state PA has 3.5 rating for 1141 reviews, offers American (New), Restaurants, Southern, Diners, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsTakeOut, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsAttire, OutdoorSeating, GoodForKids, HasTV, BusinessParking, WiFi, RestaurantsPriceRange2, BYOBCorkage, Caters, NoiseLevel, BikeParking, DogsAllowed, Alcohol, HappyHour, RestaurantsTableService, RestaurantsReservations, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsDelivery, GoodForMeal, Ambience and lacks None.

And the cocktails are great, too.","combined_id":"DmiRdvi_7cyECHZh7lppdw_d_tRshM-w6S4QxE4VVi8tQ","businessDetails":"Jones in city Philadelphia state PA has 3.5 rating for 1141 reviews, offers American (New), Restaurants, Southern, Diners, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, RestaurantsTakeOut, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsAttire, OutdoorSeating, GoodForKids, HasTV, BusinessParking, WiFi, RestaurantsPriceRange2, BYOBCorkage, Caters, NoiseLevel, BikeParking, DogsAllowed, Alcohol, HappyHour, RestaurantsTableService, RestaurantsReservations, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsDelivery, GoodForMeal, Ambience and lacks None.

If you order to go, they call the number on your receipt when your order is ready. \n\nMy fiance and I tried the place out the first week it opened. We each ordered a crab cake platter since they are known for their crab cakes. We also ordered a cup of soup each since it was cold out. The portions were small but the crab cake was very good. It was full of crab and not fillers. \n\nThe soups were amazing! I had a crab chowder and it was full of crab, not too creamy and great seasoning. \n\nThe second time we came, I ordered the crab cake sandwich. The brioche bun was a little too much for the 6 oz crab cake. I had to gut out the bun. That allowed me to enjoy the crab cake more. \n\nThe next day my sister came to visit and wanted to try it. This time we ordered the crab balls. Definitely not as good as the crab cakes. It was full of fillers and not a great way to introduce my sister to it. \n\nMy fiance and i will definitely be back to give the rest of the menu a try.","combined_id":"ZLVPEj5TNyYDxRXH8JndKQ_psD0qpCK-iENFO9c8hmnkw","businessDetails":"Famous Crab Cakes in city Claymont state DE has 3.5 rating for 37 reviews, offers Restaurants, Seafood, Sandwiches food and it has attributes RestaurantsTableService, GoodForKids, BusinessParking, HasTV, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsPriceRange2, RestaurantsAttire, RestaurantsTakeOut, OutdoorSeating, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsReservations, GoodForMeal, BikeParking, RestaurantsDelivery, WiFi, Caters, Alcohol, BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, NoiseLevel, Ambience and lacks None.

Last Wednesday (02\/10), my brother-in-law and I ordered two entrees for pickup: I got the 4 oz. Crab Cake Platter with a Mediterranean salad, and he got the Supreme Crab Combo with a Crab Pretzel. Although I enjoyed my crab cake, I wasn't too thrilled with the Mediterranean salad; I thought I was going to get an actual salad and instead I got pasta salad in an odd-tasting peppery sauce (?). Also, I wasn't too keen on the price. $8.99 for a small-ish crab cake is a bit steep in my opinion. I understand good crab meat can be expensive, but I have a feeling Rigatoni's tends to lean towards the high end of the pricing scale for no other reason than the fact that they have no competition. \n\nMy brother-in-law wasn't entirely pleased with his meal. He said it was \"all right\", but then felt nauseous afterwards. He was sick for most of the evening nursing a queasy stomach. My sister tried some of the Crab Pretzel and started feeling sick late that evening into the next morning. Maybe there were some pieces of crab that weren't exactly fresh in that pretzel or in my brother-in-law's meal, but I do know that my crab cake was very good, and the pieces of the Crab Pretzel I ate didn't give me any digestive problems. Still, it's disconcerting that two out of three people who ate something from this establishment got sick. I don't like playing stomach roulette when I go out to eat.","combined_id":"t3961-lcaVdEbigkHar3oQ_psD0qpCK-iENFO9c8hmnkw","businessDetails":"Famous Crab Cakes in city Claymont state DE has 3.5 rating for 37 reviews, offers Restaurants, Seafood, Sandwiches food and it has attributes RestaurantsTableService, GoodForKids, BusinessParking, HasTV, WheelchairAccessible, RestaurantsPriceRange2, RestaurantsAttire, RestaurantsTakeOut, OutdoorSeating, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsReservations, GoodForMeal, BikeParking, RestaurantsDelivery, WiFi, Caters, Alcohol, BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, NoiseLevel, Ambience and lacks None.

It was not enough to deduct, but enough to comment about.  I was also planning on driving to New Orleans, but when I found out that it was $45 a day for valet and no self-parking was available, I ditched the plan to drive and flew in instead.  BTW, once I got here, I realized that meter parking is available in and around the hotel, and that you don't have to feed the meters a portion of the weekend.  I checked in the same afternoon as two of my siblings, and even though the reservations were all done separate, we were fortunate enough to get a room next door to theirs.  The staff at the front desk and the concierge were helpful as expected.  The room was OK.  The hinges on the armoire that the TV sat on and houses the mini fridge and drawers needed a little TLC.  When I checked in, one of the two bulbs above the bathroom vanity was burnt out.  I didn't report it, but sometime after the room was cleaned, the bulb was replaced.  The hotel gym was typical for a hotel.  The rooftop pool had a beautiful view of downtown.  Being here on the of first Saturday in August, the street in front of the hotel is virtually taken over by the Whitney White Linen Night crowd.  Checkout was at 11am, but I asked for a 1pm checkout.  It was granted, but housekeeping came by at both 11 and noon to check to see if I had already gone.","combined_id":"kMoVKAatAOh6JmWBgQT8zQ_3NdRfVpi3-tfk9vdiJ_F7w","businessDetails":"Renaissance New Orleans Arts Warehouse District Hotel in city New Orleans state LA has 4.0 rating for 180 reviews, offers Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, BusinessAcceptsBitcoin, WiFi, DogsAllowed, RestaurantsPriceRange2, WheelchairAccessible and lacks None.

I love the location of the hotel!  It is convenient to all of the places I love to visit while in New Orleans.  I have always enjoyed my visit, until the last couple of nights there.  \nOn 9 July 2018, at approximately 4:30pm, my daughter and I returned to our room and noticed that it had not been cleaned, because we forgot to turn off the \"do not disturb\" light. Finding the housekeeping staff still working on the floor, I promptly visited the front desk and politely requested that our room be cleaned. Justin, the front desk associate, rudely informed me that it was \"too late\" to have our room cleaned. Shocked by his response, I explained that I have made a similar request at a different Marriott hotel and they kindly accommodated my request.  He stated he would give me some towels, but I could not have the room clean.  He refused to contact housekeeping to determine if it was even possible.  I couldn't believe his failure to accommodate us.  This was truly a first; especially since Marriott prides themselves on being a high customer service provider.  I am a Marriott Rewards Member and have stayed at their properties in various locations throughout the world.  Justin's service does not meet the Marriott standard! \nTo make matters worse, nor does the hotel manager, Andy King.  After hearing of my experience, my daughter visited the front desk and asked Justin if he might find a way for our room to be cleaned while we were out for dinner and he said that he would call housekeeping.  But upon our return, around 7:30pm, our room still had not be cleaned, and when she visited the front desk again, to inquire the status of our request, Justin stated that he had made the request, but the housekeeping staff was \"too busy preparing for new arrivals\" to clean our room.\"  My daughter then emailed the manager, Andy King, on 9 July, and he has yet to respond.  On the morning of 10 July, I visited Andy King's office at approximately 9:10 a.m. and was told to leave my email address, because he had not arrived to work yet.  I have not heard from Andy King either.  \nJustin behaves the way he does because his manager, Andy King, allows it.  The worst customer service ever!\nI still have not received my Marriott Rewards.  I also wish they offered Vegan food options.","combined_id":"8Yf0q6CSoVJ2PzKIc-IRDg_3NdRfVpi3-tfk9vdiJ_F7w","businessDetails":"Renaissance New Orleans Arts Warehouse District Hotel in city New Orleans state LA has 4.0 rating for 180 reviews, offers Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, BusinessAcceptsBitcoin, WiFi, DogsAllowed, RestaurantsPriceRange2, WheelchairAccessible and lacks None.

Check in yesterday went smoothly. The front desk agent was lovely and we got great room with a view even though we booked third party. Unfortunately, the room was not the cleanest. There were marshmallows on the floor and a lot of the counter surfaces were not wiped down. I didn't see it as too big of a deal but I expect a 4 star hotel to be clean. Valet parking is $40 a night. That seems pretty steep. Also, internet is an additional $11 a day. Keep those fees in mind if you want to book here. My biggest complaint is what happened to us tonight. We received a knock on our door at about 9:30 pm. I had just got back from getting a few groceries. It had already been a long day because I had two kiddos that were not feeling too well. A man was at the door. He did not introduce himself or anything. I seriously thought it was some drunk guy at the wrong door until I noticed the tag on his coat. He said that he had received several noise complaints about us. I looked at my daughter confused and said, \"Were we being too loud?\".The guy looked at me and said he had been listening at our door for a few minutes and yes, we were being too loud! What in the world?!?!? How creepy is that?! So not only do you not introduce yourself as a manager or front desk agent or anything, you then tell me you have been sitting outside my room door listening. Also, if he had received several complaints then why didn't I receive a phone call after the first one? Surely, if we were being too loud I would have liked to have been informed. It was so odd. We were gone for the hour prior to that so none of it made sense to me. I am a full-time traveler and I have stayed at many hotels. However, this is the first time I have ever received a noise complaint and this is the first time I have ever felt the need to write a negative review. There has to be a better procedure for addressing a noise complaint. Surely a phone call at first and surely introducing yourself would be standard. Geez! I am seriously upset by this. For the price of this hotel, I just can't recommend it. Also, the hot tub was not working today and the pool is pretty tiny but it was nice that they at least had a pool. \n\nPositives: \nGood location \nPool\nUnique History\nUnique Decor\n\nNegative:\nHefty Valet fee\nSmall pool\nRude staff\nPaper thin walls\nDirty room","combined_id":"YpaMQqUoMHdQSSQpmClXiQ_3NdRfVpi3-tfk9vdiJ_F7w","businessDetails":"Renaissance New Orleans Arts Warehouse District Hotel in city New Orleans state LA has 4.0 rating for 180 reviews, offers Hotels, Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Venues & Event Spaces food and it has attributes BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, BusinessAcceptsBitcoin, WiFi, DogsAllowed, RestaurantsPriceRange2, WheelchairAccessible and lacks None.

Two small complaints: the cashier who took my order was not terribly friendly. Not a huge deal, but also didn't give the best first impression. I also felt like things were a two overpriced. $9 for two pancakes seems a little steep. That being said, the banana wheat germ pancakes were delicious! I am not typically a pancake person, but these were great. Didn't need any syrup (which is great, since I don't really like an overly sweet breakfast). The pancakes alone were perfectly balanced.

You have to order at the counter and then wait for them to bring your food to you. I would recommend the wheat germ pancakes (banana or blueberry are fantastic), the bacon is cheap and the eggs cheaper. I wouldn't order the bacon and eggs again. We ate there on a Friday at around 9:30am and had our pick of almost any table on the beach. I took away one star because of the bacon\/eggs and the prices were a little high...

They definitely built East Beach Grill on the beach, and -- especially on holidays -- people come. If you've got a thing for great expanses of water and sand, I can imagine no finer location for a restaurant, although this particular place combines their much-coveted location with a slightly harsh, utilitarian, almost food-service feel: plastic chairs and tables, ketchup splurted out of dispensers, order numbers constantly barked through a muddy P.A. system.\n\nThis makes The Habit look like The French Laundry, especially on crowded days when it feels like civilization might well come to an end then and there. But during quiet times, I've actually enjoyed this place; I think I want to come back soon some weekend morning, taking brief bike ride or longish stroll from downtown and grabbing a simple breakfast. I've enjoyed a fruit-and-yogurt bowl here, their fries taste well-seasoned, and their burritos look decent, given a context that really doesn't lead you to expect a decent burrito.\n\nWord on the street says that East Beach Grill's real strength lies in its fruit pancakes, and I'll return for them, but man, a lot of those burgers and related sandwiches remind me of my junior high's cafeteria. I have a feeling that if I asked what the deal is with this, I'd get little more than a complacent shrug in return, like, \"What do you want? We're on the beach\" -- the very same attitude afflicts the rest of Santa Barbara, too.","combined_id":"Wg3GgW07DJjxy3vlvKnegg_zu4p6IZLSVn2Noto-vcwzw","businessDetails":"East Beach Grill in city Santa Barbara state CA has 3.5 rating for 169 reviews, offers Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, American (Traditional) food and it has attributes Alcohol, RestaurantsPriceRange2, GoodForKids, RestaurantsTakeOut, BusinessAcceptsCreditCards, HasTV, RestaurantsGoodForGroups, RestaurantsReservations, RestaurantsAttire, BikeParking, NoiseLevel, Ambience, BusinessParking, OutdoorSeating, RestaurantsDelivery, RestaurantsTableService, Caters, WiFi, GoodForMeal and lacks None.
